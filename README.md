# Logical-Shadow-Tomography
Error mitigation using shadow tomography with single qubits pauli gatesf for state reconstruction and virtual distillation with subspace expansion as error mitigation solution. This is performed for N qubits codes and two logical qubits code encoded in the [5,1,3] error correcting code. We propose an implementation of those code on Cirq and perform simulation on QVM from google AI and IBM quantum computers.
